# üöÄ Dynamic Product Search Application

This is a full-stack web application that demonstrates a dynamic, real-time product filtering system. The project consists of a Python Flask REST API for the backend and a responsive frontend built with the Ionic Framework and React.

## ‚ú® Features

* **RESTful API:** A backend API for generating, retrieving, and searching products.
* **Dynamic Search:** A real-time search that filters products across multiple attributes (name, description, SKU, etc.) as the user types.
* **Mock Data Generation:** An endpoint to instantly populate the database with 100+ realistic product records.
* **Responsive Frontend:** A clean, mobile-first user interface built with Ionic/React components.
* **Optimized Performance:**
    * Frontend uses **debouncing** to limit API requests during rapid typing.
    * Backend uses **bulk inserts** for efficient data generation.
* **Automated Testing:** Includes a suite of tests for the critical search endpoint using Pytest.
